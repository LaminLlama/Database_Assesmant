1,Batman Begins,The Dark Knight,Superhero,4,This movie was so good! The first 30 to 40 minutes are a bit dull though.  Bruce Wayne does not become Batman until the first 40 minutes are over. The scenes were all wonderfully orchestrated and the acting was well done. I would and will totally watch this again in the next year or two. The ending tells fans that the next movie will have The Joker in it.
2,The Dark Knight,The Dark Knight,Superhero,5,The Dark Knight will forever be the greatest comic book movie ever made. The cast is once again superb and the standout performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker really make this film stand out amongst all others. It Draws the perfect line between Heroism and the villain as well as having an excellent lesson tied in within its plot. It has great action sequences and ultimately is a story about Batman being pushed to his limits to the point where he be considered neither hero nor villain. It lives up to the expectations it had upon release and probably even well exceeded them. A great film to watch and guarantee 90% of people will be blown out of their seats when watching this ultimate thrill ride about the battle between good and evil.
3,The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight,Superhero,4,"Not as good as its predecessor, which in my opinion is the best superhero film ever made, but still worth the length of three hours. It never felt dragged. I expected an unpredictable, dark, and thrilling movie, just like the other two films. But what I got was a semi-dark, dramatic and emotional farewell from a beloved franchise. Though I do not think that Bane and Ra's a Ghul's daughter's death were fleshed out properly, those aren't any major issues"
4,The Dictator,Stand Alone,Comedy,5,This Sasha Baron Cohen  comedy is a crude and obscene satire that is totally hilarious.  The dialog is crisp and callous with some great dark liines. This movie is a must see if you are not offended easily and want to have a gut busting experience.
5,Deadpool,Deadpool,Superhero,5,Deadpool is one of the greatest action /comedy films I've ever seen. When i first seen this movie i was like damn this is good and very funny. I'm glad Ryan Reyonlds was pick for the role. He's very talented and funny actor. I give this flim 5 stars for amazing performance and great cast. Its one of the best films of 2016
6,Deadpool 2,Deadpool,Superhero,4,Marvel universe has done it again this movie is  Extremely funny It doesn't have  Any of the problems that most sequels do I hope they keep making dead pool movies and I give great props to Marvel  for most of their movies I love all of their anti hero characters if you like Marvel movies this is a must see just like the 1st dead pool it is some of the best work  I have ever seen
7,Monty Python's Life of Brian,Monty Python,Comedy,4,"A timeless comedic masterpiece that satirizes religion and human nature with wit and absurdity. From ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"" to the infamous ""Biggus Dickus"" scene, this Monty Python classic never fails to entertain me."
8,Monty Python and the Holy Grail,Monty Python,Comedy,4,"The Holy Grail is by far the funniest movie I have ever seen. I have watched it at least 6 times and never get tired of it. The jokes are fast and hilarious and I see new things I have missed in previous viewings. This is without a doubt one of my favourite comedies along with Life of Brian, Meaning of Life(both Python Films) and Blazing Saddles by Mel Brooks"
9,Shrek,Shrek ,Fantasy ,5,"Shrek is by far, the best DreamWorks movie ever made by the studio. The first movie starts us off with an Ogre that lives in a swamp that eventually gets taken over by fairy tale characters. He teams up with a donkey that's named after the animal he is, makes a deal with Lord Farquaad to save a princess, and even escapes a dragon."
10,Monster Hunter,Stand Alone,Action,2,"Just finished watching this one. Cgi is gud, but apart from that everything is already seen material. They are trying too hard to make it likable which I appreciate by the way. But there is only so much we can do based on the same thread right? That's what happened here, there is nothing new in this. Protagonist reaches some other alien world somehow, and fights monster on her way back home. As usual gets a companion who is more familiar with these things. That's it. They have ended the movie like there will be a second part and i am not so eager to watch it. But If it comes out, I'll watch though. Overall a movie you can watch if you have nothing else to watch and have time to kill."
11,Jojo Rabbit,Stand Alone,Comedy,3,I didn't really think much Jojo Rabbit. I found some of it funny and some of it quite sweet but I'm amazed at how highly reviewed it is. I thought it was too satirical to be deep and taken seriously and too much of a serious subject to be funny.
12,Glory Road,Stand Alone,Drama,1,"Glory Road is another in a long line of feel-good sports movies about people who beat the odds through hard work and perseverance. We've seen it before, and we'll see it again. But that's OK. These films keep coming back for a reason. But it just wasn't my cup of tea."
