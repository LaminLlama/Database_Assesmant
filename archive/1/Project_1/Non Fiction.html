<p>Title: Don't Make Me Think</p>

<p>Genre (Text Type): Non Fiction - Usability</p>

<p>Author: Steve Krug</p>

<p>Rating: *****</p>

<p>Review / Response</p>

<p>“Don’t Make me Think” is a fun, practical book that describes the need for frequent, informal 
    testing to ensure that an interface (such as a website) is easy to use. The book’s informal 
    style is appealing and whilst some of the material is out of date, most of the information easy 
    to understand and implement.</p>

<p>The book is aimed at software developers and designers and can be read in roughly 2 hours (the 
    author argues that anything longer would be less useful). The book’s main theme is ‘Don’t make me 
    think’ ie: usable interfaces are self-explanatory. Put another way, users should not need to 
    expend any effort thinking about what to do - it should be obvious.</p>

<p>One of my favourite parts of the book is the ‘facts of life’ - they are a quick summary of how 
    users operate that might not be obvious to designers. Said ‘facts of life’ are the result 
    Krug’s observations on how people actually use his client’s interfaces. They include the 
    following ideas...</p>

            <p>Science fiction, often called "sci-fi," is a genre of fiction literature whose content is
                imaginative, but based in science. It relies heavily on scientific facts, theories, and
                principles as support for its settings, characters, themes, and plot-lines, which is what
                makes it different from fantasy</p>
