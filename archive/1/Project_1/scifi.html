            <h2>Science Fiction</h2>

            <p>Title: Saturn Run</p>

            <p>Genre (Text Type): Science Fiction / Thriller</p>

            <p>Authors: John Sandford and Ctein</p>

            <p>Rating: ****</p>

            <p>Review / Response</p>

            <p>'Saturn Run' begins with an intern discovering a possible alien craft decelerating towards Saturn.
                This sparks a 'race to Saturn' with America trying to beat China to the ringed planet (and any
                possible alien technology).</p>

            <p>The story is fast moving and compelling. The characters are well developed and as a reader I became
                quite invested in their personal stories. Whilst the book took quite a while to read, the journey
                was worth while. The Physics underlying the novel has been well researched and this helps to make
                the story both interesting and believable.</p>

            <p>The tight plot kept me engaged throughout and the author also used the story as a way of exploring
                politics, science and ultimately what it means to be human. It was a relief to see that the
                authors shied away from some of the cliches typically found in this genre and the result was a
                well crafted novel that appeals to a wide audience.</p>

            <p>Science fiction, often called "sci-fi," is a genre of fiction literature whose content is
                imaginative, but based in science. It relies heavily on scientific facts, theories, and
                principles as support for its settings, characters, themes, and plot-lines, which is what
                makes it different from fantasy</p>
